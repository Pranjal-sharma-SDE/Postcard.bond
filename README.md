Product Engineer Case Study:
Postcard.bond
You are a junior web developer at Postcard.bond, a platform that allows users to create
and send physical postcards to other users. The platform charges a fee of $3 per
postcard.
Your team has been working on a new feature that allows users to customize the
images on their postcards by adding a prompt. The platform uses a machine learning
model to generate a selection of images based on the prompt. Users have the option to
generate up to 6 free images, and can pay an additional fee to generate more if they are
not satisfied with the options.
You have been tasked with implementing this feature.
Prompt
Implement the new image customization feature for Postcard.bond.
Requirements
The feature should allow users to add a prompt when creating a postcard.
Product Engineer Case Study: Postcard.bond 2
The platform should use a machine learning model to generate a selection of
images based on the prompt.
Users should have the option to generate up to 6 free images.
Users should have the option to pay an additional fee to generate more images if
they are not satisfied with the options.
The feature should be implemented using the ReactJS framework for the frontend,
and Node.js with Express for the backend.
The feature should use a MongoDB database to store user and order data.
Deliverables
A working prototype of the feature.
Additional Notes
Consider the following questions when implementing the feature:
How will the prompt be entered by the user?
How will the machine learning model be used to generate the images?
How will the generated images be displayed to the user?
How will the user be able to select the desired image?
How will the additional image generation fee be implemented?
How will the user be notified of the additional image generation fee?
To complete this case study, you will need to set up a development environment and
implement the feature according to the requirements. You should also consider testing
the feature to ensure it is working as expected.
